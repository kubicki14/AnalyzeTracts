This is the starting project folder for AnalyzeTracts, where the high-level objective is to discern feature factors that are  relevant and important when considering contracts with the government. This could be anything from certain keywords andd phrase words being stated and mentioned, to different terms of agreement that the procurement officers adhere to. It is known that most factors that are relevant to providing an optimal contract are better found through social engineering and communication diriectly with the procurement officers to discern what they prefer and what they look for explicitly, as every state has different personnel who operate in specific manners.

With this in mind we want to complete an exploratory analysis which passes over all possible patterns formed by those who succesesfully acquire and complete government contracts versus both acquired+Incomplete contracts and not_acquired contracts.
