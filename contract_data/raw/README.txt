Both files came from the kaggle dataset at the link below:

	https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-contracts/version/55

65% of the dataset have contract listings that DON'T have a contract associated with them, so analysis of those cases are limited.
For this purpose we are ONLY analyzing 35% of the dataset, which is 45,750 / 129,332 rows. (Still a lot of information!)
